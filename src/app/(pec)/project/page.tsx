    clientNarrative:
      "The project entailed capacity improvement of the Kampala Northern Bypass comprising the construction of a 17.5 km second carriageway alongside the existing carriageway (between Busega and Hoima road - on the LHS of the existing carriageway and between Gayaza Road and Namboole - on the RHS of the existing Northern Bypass), sidewalks, grade-separated junctions, junction lighting and signalization, and ancillary works. The consultant supervised swamp treatment (excavation, rockfilling, geotextile, consolidation monitoring, and preparation of stable working platforms, etc.) for the entire road, as well as RC bridge works at Sentema Road, Hoima Road, Gayaza Road and Kyebando interchanges, including asphalt trials. The total length of road section whose capacity was improved (dualled) is 17.5 Km",
